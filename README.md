# Face Detection App

This Face Detection App is built using Python and OpenCV. It uses a pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifier to detect faces in real-time from your webcam.

## Features
- **Real-Time Face Detection**: Detects faces from the webcam feed and highlights them with rectangles.
- **Simple and Fast**: Uses the efficient Haar Cascade algorithm for quick face detection.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- PyInstaller (optional for creating an executable)

## Installation
1. Install Python and pip.
2. Install OpenCV:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
